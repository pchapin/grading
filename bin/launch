# SUBJECT     : Script to return graded materials.
# LAST REVISED: August 28, 2001
#
# This script returns graded materials to the students. It assumes all
# the graded work is in files with a .txt extension in the current dir-
# ectory. The base part of the file name is the student's username on
# twilight. After mailing all the files, this script packs them in an
# archive for safekeeping.
#
# Expected parameters: course-name lesson-designation.
#   course-name       : All upper case with a dash (CS-211)
#   lesson-designation: All upper case with a dash and two digit worksheet
#                       number (WORK-02)
