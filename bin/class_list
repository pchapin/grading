# SUBJECT : This script is a skeleton for processing my class list.
# AUTHOR  : Peter C. Chapin <PChapin@vtc.vsc.edu>
#
# This script can be used as a basis for a variety of scripts that scan over my class list and
# do various operations on the students found therein. Copy this script to a new file and edit
# it (see comments below) according to the needs of your particular application.

# appropriate variable for later. This is a support function.
